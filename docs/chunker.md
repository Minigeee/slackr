Here's a strategic approach to message chunking for a RAG system, particularly in a Slack context:

### Message Chunking Strategy

1. **Pre-Processing Steps**
   - Remove irrelevant elements (e.g., excessive whitespace, emojis if not meaningful)
   - Normalize formatting (standardize line breaks, spacing)
   - Identify special content (code blocks, lists, quotes) that should stay together

2. **Chunking Rules**
   - **Size-based boundaries**
     - Target chunk size: 512-1024 tokens
     - Allow flexibility based on natural breakpoints
     - Maintain minimum chunk size (e.g., 128 tokens) to avoid fragments

   - **Semantic boundaries**
     - Prefer breaking at:
       - Paragraph breaks
       - End of sentences
       - Natural topic transitions
       - After complete thoughts
     - Never break within:
       - Code blocks
       - URLs
       - User mentions
       - Lists (keep items together)

3. **Overlap Strategy**
   - Include 1-2 sentences of overlap between chunks
   - More overlap for technical/complex content
   - Less overlap for simple conversational content

4. **Special Considerations for Slack**
   - Keep thread replies connected to parent message
   - Preserve conversation flow in multi-person discussions
   - Maintain context of reactions and emoji responses
   - Keep code blocks intact with surrounding explanation

5. **Metadata Attachment**
   - Each chunk should retain:
     - Original message timestamp
     - Author information
     - Channel context
     - Position in original message
     - Links to previous/next chunks

6. **Context Preservation**
   - Include thread parent references
   - Maintain conversation markers
   - Keep question-answer pairs together
   - Preserve important @mentions

This approach balances:
- Semantic coherence
- Information density
- Retrieval effectiveness
- Processing efficiency

The goal is to create chunks that are:
- Self-contained enough to be meaningful
- Small enough to be efficiently processed
- Contextually rich enough for accurate retrieval
- Logically connected to preserve conversation flow
